## Overview
[Viewing Party](https://github.com/InOmn1aParatus/viewing_party) is a 10-day, paired project during Turing School of Software and Design's Back-End Engineering program in Module 3. The goal was to create a Rails application that consumes APIs, where users can explore movie options and create a viewing party event for the user and friends. The database utilizes a self-referential relationship to allow users to have friends, similar to follower functionality on Twitter.

This application is built off of the base repo for the [viewing party project](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/viewing_party) used for Turing's Backend Module 3.

## Features
- A user can *register* for the site and *log in and out* using our basic authentication/authorization functions.
  - These functions include authorization to view certain pages of the site only when logged in.
- Using the **Discover** page, users can select from the Top 40 movies according to ***TheMovieDB*** API.
- From the movie's show page, a user can create a *viewing party* with any friend they have added through their dashboard.
- A user can view their list of current friends, as well as a list of viewing parties they are hosting along with the list of attendees.

## Learning Goals
The learning goals for this project centered around API consumption, manipulation of JSON responses, and basic authentication & authorization.
